# My Linode Kubernetes Engine Configuration

Bootstraps a Linode Kubernetes Engine for messing around the way I like it.  
There is little point in using this configuration for anything that you need.

## Usage

`terraform init` the repository folder after cloning, then `terraform login` to my organization finally `terraform apply` the configuration.
